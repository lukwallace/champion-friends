# League Friends
A d3js replication of this cool blog post I saw

#Goal
Create a (very minimal) web app that replicates the functionality of this [blogpost](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/find-your-lunch-table-which-champs-are-friends).

#Synopsis
League of Legends is a MOBA game. Two teams of five players pick roles and characters to play as -- typically referred to as champions. Players have champion preferences i.e if you like playing as __champion A__ you'll enjoy playing __champion B__ and for the same reasons avoid __champion C__. The goal is to visualize these preferences in the form of a node-link graph. Let one node represent a champion __A__, and a link be the tendency in which players choose another __champion B__ given that they prefer __champion A__

#Steps towards Completion - Edited while project in progress

* Figure out how to do grunt stuff from scratch
* Setup functionality for query champion mastery data from Riot API
* Study up on d3js node graph creation  
* Organize data into format that can be plotted in a graph
* Plot that graph
* Add database stuff ... ? 


#Motivation
Data stuff is interest

#Installation

#License
I don't know anything about this yet
